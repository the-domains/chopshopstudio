Roman Mars's (show host & creator) motto follows the logic that if a number of individuals went through all the trouble to commemorate an event that took in a place near where you are standing... it is probably worth your time to read the plaque they erected. Created in 2014 for 99% Invisible's second Kickstarter campaign. The design is still available as a t-shirt on chopshopstore.com.
